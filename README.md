### INSTALLATION PROCESS
1.```None```
Complete! 
If you want to do a FASTER installation, in the 0.72 (Maybe not released yet...) add the Roblox Item into the folder.
### After Commands
Raspberry will INSTALL new parts of the Roblox Launcher or RobloxPlayer.
HOMEBREW ISN'T REQUIRED!!
People have said that it is BUT IT IS NOT! Homebrew makes crashes Raspberry Client, causing Raspberry Client to NOT work.

Command: ```$MaveDex```


Thanks for using Raspberry Client!!!
